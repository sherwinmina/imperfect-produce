         Imperfect is a mission-driven startup that is creating America's first major consumer brand for "ugly" produce. One in five fruits and vegetables grown in America never make it off the farm due to tiny cosmetic defects that do not affect quality. Imperfect is on a mission to find a home for these misshapen fruits and veggies in people's fridges by selling them for a 30-50% discount with a lovable, hip brand. We offer the cheapest and most environmentally friendly produce option, starting with our weekly produce delivery service in the Bay Area. In addition to building a scalable solution to fight food waste, our business model also generates extra revenue to California farmers. Imperfect has been featured on the Today Show, The New York Times, National Geographic, PBS NewsHour, NPR, Washington Post, Food and Wine, and the front page of the SF Chronicle. We have put together a team of the leading food waste entrepreneurs in the country and are working with world-class advisors, including Doug Rauch, former President of Trader Joe's.
